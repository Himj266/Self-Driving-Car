# Self-Driving-Car
A Self Driving Car

The AI (Artificial Intelligence) for this self driving car will be written in pytorch.

[Pytorch](http://pytorch.org/) is available only for windows and OSX. But you can install [docker](https://www.docker.com/) or [VM VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) in case you have windows, to run this project.

#### Important
==============
If you have Nvidia GPU on your system. Then Pytorch also offers [CUDA](https://www.geforce.com/hardware/technology/cuda) support.


[Check Here](https://www.geforce.com/hardware/technology/cuda/supported-gpus) wheather your NVIDIA GPU is supported by CUDA.

## CUDA
By the way CUDA is a parallel computing platform and programming model invented by NVIDIA. It enables dramatic increases in computing performance by harnessing the power of the graphics processing unit (GPU).
